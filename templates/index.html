    Welcome to Kieran's Magic: the Gathering game logger, for all your game tracking needs.<br><br>
    To get started, head to the Input page and create a player for yourself.<br>
    Once that is done, you can start adding your decks to the database.<br><br>
    The Data page lets you view tables of data.<br>
    Select "Colour Identity" to view the number of decks of each colour identity.<br>
    Select "Deck" to view information about each deck.<br>
    Select "Player" to view how many decks each player owns.<br><br>
    The Graphs page lets you view data in either bar chart or pie chart form.
